# Study Strategies & Interview Preparation

## Study Strategies

### 1. Daily Study Schedule

**Answer:** A structured daily schedule helps maintain consistency and cover all necessary topics.

**Sample Daily Schedule (4 hours):**
```
Morning (1 hour):
- Review previous day's concepts
- Read new theory/concepts
- Watch educational videos

Afternoon (2 hours):
- Solve coding problems (LeetCode/HackerRank)
- Practice system design problems
- Work on projects

Evening (1 hour):
- Review solutions and optimize code
- Practice explaining concepts out loud
- Prepare for next day's topics
```

**Weekly Focus Areas:**
```
Monday: Data Structures & Algorithms
Tuesday: Frontend Development (JavaScript/React/Vue)
Wednesday: Backend Development (Node.js/Python/Laravel)
Thursday: System Design & Architecture
Friday: Mock Interviews & Practice
Saturday: Project Building & Portfolio
Sunday: Review & Weak Area Improvement
```

### 2. Mock Interview Preparation

**Answer:** Mock interviews simulate real interview conditions and help identify areas for improvement.

**Mock Interview Schedule:**
```
Week 1: 2 mock interviews
Week 2: 3 mock interviews
Week 3: 4 mock interviews
Week 4: 5 mock interviews
```

**Mock Interview Process:**
1. **Preparation (15 minutes):**
   - Set up coding environment
   - Prepare questions to ask
   - Review company information

2. **Interview (45-60 minutes):**
   - Technical problem solving
   - Code implementation
   - System design discussion
   - Behavioral questions

3. **Feedback (15 minutes):**
   - Receive feedback on performance
   - Identify areas for improvement
   - Plan next steps

**Mock Interview Platforms:**
- **Pramp:** Free peer-to-peer mock interviews
- **Interviewing.io:** Anonymous technical interviews
- **LeetCode Mock Interviews:** Simulated coding interviews
- **HackerRank Mock Interviews:** Practice technical interviews

### 3. System Design Interview Process

**Answer:** System design interviews test your ability to design large-scale systems and communicate technical concepts.

**System Design Interview Structure:**
```
1. Requirements Clarification (5-10 minutes)
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Scale and constraints

2. High-Level Design (10-15 minutes)
   - Overall architecture
   - Main components
   - Data flow

3. Detailed Design (15-20 minutes)
   - Database design
   - API design
   - Caching strategy
   - Security considerations

4. Scale and Optimization (10-15 minutes)
   - Performance optimization
   - Scalability improvements
   - Fault tolerance
   - Monitoring and logging
```

**Common System Design Topics:**
- **URL Shortener (like bit.ly)**
- **Chat System (like WhatsApp)**
- **Social Media Feed (like Twitter)**
- **Video Streaming (like Netflix)**
- **E-commerce Platform (like Amazon)**
- **Search Engine (like Google)**
- **File Storage (like Dropbox)**
- **Real-time Analytics (like Uber)**

**System Design Preparation:**
1. **Study Patterns:** Load balancing, caching, database sharding
2. **Practice Drawing:** Use tools like draw.io or Lucidchart
3. **Know Trade-offs:** Understand pros/cons of different approaches
4. **Practice Explaining:** Be able to explain your design clearly
5. **Stay Updated:** Follow latest trends in system architecture
